Configuration files for lava-dispatcher
=======================================

lava-dispatcher looks for files in:

 * Alongside the installation/source tree for the default values
   (i.e. this directory).

 * /etc/xdg/lava-dispatcher for system-wide settings.

 * ~/.config/lava-dispatcher for user settings.

Each config directory can contain two files and two directories:

 * lava-dispatcher.conf

   This file defines global settings of the dispatcher.  You will
   almost certainly need to customize LAVA_SERVER_IP for your install.

 * device-defaults.conf

   This file defines default values for all devices.  You probably
   won't need to customize it.

 * device-types/

   This directory contains a config file for each device type.  You
   probably won't need to customize the settings for device types that
   are already supported by lava-dispatcher, but if you are working on
   supporting a new class of device, you will need to add a file here.

   Note that the device-type name must match the --dev argument to
   linaro-media-create.

 * devices/

   This directory contains a file per device that can be targeted by
   lava-dispatcher.  For the most part this file just needs to contain
   a line "device_type = <device type>", although other settings can
   be included here.  You will definitely need to tell lava-dispatcher
   about the devices you have!

* logging.conf

   This file defines settings for Python logging
