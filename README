LAVA - Automated Validation for Linaro
======================================

LAVA is a bundle of software that allows automated testing of Linaro images.

It contains code both for running the tests (the "dispatcher" in local jargon)
and requesting/organizing the running of the tests (the "scheduler").

Code-wise, it consists of three major parts:

 - the dispatcher
 - the scheduler interface
 - the scheduler daemon

Quickstart
----------

You need to have the xxx, yyy and zzz packages installed.

To set up the virtual environment with all the Python dependencies,
run "make".

Then, to run the interface, run "./bin/manage runserver" (after
running "make").

Running the dispatcher requires a bit of setting up.  See below.

To run the daemon ...

The Dispatcher
--------------

The code for the dispatcher lives in lava.dispatcher.

XXX write this -- reference ./doc/QUICKSTART or copy it here.

The Scheduler Interface
-----------------------

The code for the scheduler interface lives in
lava.scheduler.interface.

It is a Django application that provides both a human (i.e. HTML) and
machine (i.e. XML-RPC) interface to the scheduling of jobs.  It is a
fairly simple interface to a database in the traditional Django-Python
webapp style.

It will delegate to Launchpad for auth and the API side will probably
use OAuth for authentication.

To be able to use the admin interface, log in via Launchpad OpenID and
then run "bin/manage makesupersuser $your_lp_id".


The Scheulder Daemon
--------------------

This doesn't actually exist yet.
