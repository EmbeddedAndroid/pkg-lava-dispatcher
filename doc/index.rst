   liking, but it should at least contain the root `toctree` directive.

LAVA Dispatcher Documentation
=============================
LAVA Dispatcher is used to dispatch test jobs from server(master node) to the target
boards in validation farm, and publish the test result back to dashboard. It is
scheduled by validation scheduler, and it could also run as standalone.

You can see an up-to-date list of supported target devices by looking at the
`device types`_ in Launchpad.

.. _device types: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~linaro-validation/lava-dispatcher/trunk/files/head:/lava_dispatcher/default-config/lava-dispatcher/device-types

Installation
============

The best way to install this is by doing a full deployment of LAVA. This is
documented on our `main project page`_. However, you can also setup the
dispatcher for `stand-alone development and testing`_.
