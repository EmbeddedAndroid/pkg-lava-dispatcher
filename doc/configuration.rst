Configuration
=============

Guideline
^^^^^^^^^

Please refer to README in lava-dispatcher source code::

    lava-dispatcher/lava_dispatcher/default-config/lava-dispatcher/README

Or browse on the `web page <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~linaro-validation/lava-dispatcher/trunk/view/head:/lava_dispatcher/default-config/lava-dispatcher/README>`_

Don't forget to setup LAVA_SERVER_IP, and LAVA_PROXY if there is one proxy,
which will prompt the performance explicitly.

You can set up a squid service, refer to :ref:`proxy`
