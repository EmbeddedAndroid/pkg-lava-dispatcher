Dependencies
------------

LAVA needs python >= 2.6.

For the LAVA client, you need the pexpect module.


Configuring for local development
---------------------------------
For LAVA development and testing using only locally attached resources,
you should be able to make use of most features, even without the use of
special equipment such as a console server.

First install conmux and cu:
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linaro-maintainers/tools
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install conmux cu

Connect a development board to a local serial device (e.g. ttyUSB0).
You may have permission problem with cu running as root under conmux.
An easy workaround for this is to create a rule under /etc/udev/rules.d
with the following line:
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyUSB0", MODE="0666"

Create a configuration file for your board under /etc/conmux which
should look something like this:
    listener panda01
    application console 'panda01 console' 'cu -l /dev/ttyUSB0 -s 115200'

Finally start conmux:
    sudo start conmux

You can test the connection using:
    conmux-console panda01
    (use ~$quit to exit)


Dispatching a job
-----------------

From the toplevel, run:
    ./lava-dispatch doc/abrek-ltp-job.json
